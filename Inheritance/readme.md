# Inheritance

## Definition:

Inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object (prototypal inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), using the same implementation.

### Additional Comments:

Inheritance is a core OOP concept and is used in most object oriented languages. However, while inheritance has its place, composition of basic objects into more complex objects is often favored.
