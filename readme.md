# Polyglot Concepts

The purpose of this respository is to highlight key programmatic concepts and provide examples of implementing them in different languages. It is primarily a learning and reference resource so any contributions are not only welcomed but encouraged!

## Intent

I hope to provide both simple examples (animal, shape, product, etc.) as well as a practical use case for each of the concepts or patterns that are included.
